# Azure VM deployment

This day has come - we are deploying a cloud infrastructure! In this task, you will deploy a virtual machine, and configure it to host your own web application!

## How to complete tasks in this module

Tasks in this module are relying on 2 PowerShell scripts:

- `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` generates the task "artifacts" and uploads them to cloud storage. An "artifact" is evidence of a task completed by you. Each task will have its own script, which will gather the required artifacts. The script also adds a link to the generated artifact in the `artifacts.json` file in this repository â€” make sure to commit changes to this file after you run the script.
- `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1` validates the artifacts generated by the first script. It loads information about the task artifacts from the `artifacts.json` file.

Here is how to complete tasks in this module:

1. Clone task repository

2. Make sure you completed steps, described in the Prerequisites section

3. Complete the task, described in the Requirements section

4. Run `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` to generate task artifacts. Script will update the file `artifacts.json` in this repo.

5. Run `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1` to test yourself. If tests are failing - follow the recomendation from the test script error message to fix or re-deploy your infrastructure. When you will be ready to test yourself again - **re-generate the artifacts** (step 4) and re-run tests again.

6. When all tests will pass - commit your changes and submit the solution for a review.

## Prerequisites

Before completing any task in the module, make sure that you followed all the steps described in the **Environment Setup** topic, in particular:

1. Ensure you have an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) account and subscription.

2. Create a resource group called _"mate-resources"_ in the Azure subscription.

3. In the _"mate-resources"_ resource group, create a storage account (any name) and a _"task-artifacts"_ container.

4. Install [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4) on your computer. All tasks in this module use Powershell 7. To run it in the terminal, execute the following command:

   ```
   pwsh
   ```

5. Install [Azure module for PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?view=azps-11.3.0):
   `    Install-Module -Name Az -Repository PSGallery -Force
   `
   If you are a Windows user, before running this command, please also run the following:
   `    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   `

6. Log in to your Azure account using PowerShell:
   ```
   Connect-AzAccount -TenantId <your Microsoft Entra ID tenant id>
   ```

## Requirements

In this task, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a Virtual Machine:

   1. Create a new resource group `mate-azure-task-2`

   2. Create a Linux Virtual Machine in the resource group from the previous step:

      - Use any allowed VM name
      - Use `UK South` Azure region
      - Set avalibility option to `No infrastructure redundancy`
      - Use `Standard`security type
      - Use `Ubuntu Server 22.04` as an operating system (publisher - `Cannonical`)
      - Use `B1s` VM size
      - Use SSH key authentification (use your own SSH key)
      - Make sure VM is deployed **without auto-generated public IP**

   3. Create and attach public IP with SKU 'Basic'. Create a DNS label for the public IP.

   4. Configure VM's Network Security Group to accept network connections on 22 and 8080 TCP ports, for that create **two separate NSG rules**

2. Deploy the web application to the virtual machine

   1. Connect to the VM using SSH, create a folder `/app`, and configure your user as an owned of the folder:

      ```
          ssh <your-vm-username>@<your-public-ip-DNS-name>
          sudo mkdir /app
          sudo chown <your-vm-username>:<your-vm-username> /app
      ```

   2. Form your computer, copy the content of the folder `app` to your virtual machine (run the command in the folder of this repository):

      ```
          scp -r app/* <your-vm-username>@<your-public-ip-DNS-name>:/app
      ```

   3. Connect to the virtual machine again using SSH, install pre-requirements, and configure a service for the application

      ```
          sudo apt install python3-pip
          cd /app
          sudo mv todoapp.service /etc/systemd/system/
          sudo systemctl daemon-reload
          sudo systemctl start todoapp
          sudo systemctl enable todoapp
      ```

   4. Verify that web app service is running, for that, run the following command on the VM:

      ```
          systemctl status todoapp
      ```

3. Verify that web application is running, for that, open in a web browser the following URL: `http://<your-public-ip-DNS-name>:8080`. You should see the main page of the todo app.

4. Run artifacts generation script `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1`

5. Test yourself using the script `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1`

6. Sumbit the solution for a review

7. When solution is validated, stop the virtual machine. !
